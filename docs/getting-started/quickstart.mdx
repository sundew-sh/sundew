## Prerequisites

You need one of the following:

- **Docker** (recommended) -- no other dependencies required
- **Python 3.11+** -- for pip installation or running from source

## Step 1: Start Sundew

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Docker">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sundew-sh/sundew.git
    cd sundew
    docker compose up
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pip">
    ```bash
    pip install sundew
    sundew serve
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="From source">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sundew-sh/sundew.git
    cd sundew
    make run
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Sundew generates a unique persona on first run and starts listening:

```
INFO   Sundew v0.1.0 starting...
INFO   Persona loaded: Northvane Analytics (fintech)
INFO   Endpoints: /api/v2/transactions, /api/v2/accounts, /api/v2/customers
INFO   MCP server active: query_transactions, get_customer_profile, read_config
INFO   Listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Every deployment gets a different persona. Your instance might be a healthcare platform, a SaaS product, or an e-commerce API. This is by design.

## Step 2: Explore Your Deployment

Open a second terminal and see what your honeypot looks like to an AI agent:

```bash
# Discover the API
curl http://localhost:8080/.well-known/ai-plugin.json

# Read the OpenAPI spec
curl http://localhost:8080/openapi.json

# Hit an endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v2/transactions?limit=5
```

The responses will match your persona -- realistic data, appropriate headers, consistent naming conventions.

## Step 3: See the Classification

Back in the first terminal, you'll see Sundew logging and scoring each request:

```
12:04:31 GET  /.well-known/ai-plugin.json     src=127.0.0.1    signal=ai_discovery
12:04:32 GET  /openapi.json                    src=127.0.0.1    signal=api_enum
12:04:33 GET  /api/v2/transactions?limit=5     src=127.0.0.1    signal=data_access
```

Query the captured sessions:

```bash
sundew query --last-session
```

```
Session: a3f8c2d1
  Source:         127.0.0.1
  Requests:       3
  Duration:       2.1s
  Classification: human (confidence: 0.22)
  Signals:
    timing:       0.15 (irregular intervals)
    enumeration:  0.30 (partial path discovery)
    headers:      0.20 (normal browser headers)
    prompt_leak:  0.00 (no LLM artifacts)
    mcp:          0.00 (no MCP connection)
```

Manual curl requests classify as `human` because your timing is irregular and you're not connecting via MCP.

## Step 4: Simulate an AI Agent

Run the built-in simulator to see how a real AI agent attack looks:

```bash
# In a third terminal
sundew simulate --profile ai_recon_agent --target http://localhost:8080
```

Now check the logs:

```
SESSION CLASSIFIED: ai_agent (confidence: 0.91)
  Timing:      0.85 (consistent 200-800ms intervals)
  Enumeration: 0.92 (systematic path discovery)
  Headers:     0.78 (missing Referer, bot-like UA)
  MCP:         1.00 (connected via MCP protocol)
  Prompt leak: 0.88 ("As an AI assistant" in POST body)
```

The simulator mimics the behavioral patterns of autonomous AI agents -- systematic discovery, consistent timing, MCP protocol usage, and LLM artifacts in request bodies.

## Step 5: Try a Different Persona

Generate a completely different deployment:

```bash
sundew generate --persona healthcare
sundew serve --persona ./data/persona.yaml
```

Same Sundew, completely different identity. Different endpoints, different data, different headers. An agent that learned to recognize the fintech deployment has zero advantage here.
