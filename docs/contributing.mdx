description: "How to contribute to Sundew -- from code to persona packs to research data."
---

Sundew is open source and welcomes contributions. Whether you are a security researcher, a Python developer, or someone who wants to deploy a honeypot and share findings, there is a way to help.

## Ways to Contribute

### Code

Bug fixes, new features, performance improvements, and test coverage.

- **New trap types** -- GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, SSH
- **Fingerprinting improvements** -- new detection signals, better classification
- **Persona engine enhancements** -- support for more industries, better LLM prompts
- **CLI improvements** -- new query commands, better output formatting

### Persona Packs

Pre-built persona packs that let Sundew run without an LLM. Each pack needs:
- A realistic company identity for a specific industry
- At least 5 REST endpoints with varied response structures
- MCP tools matching the industry theme
- Realistic fake data with valid formats (UUIDs, emails, timestamps)

### Research Data

Deploy Sundew and share anonymized capture data:

```bash
sundew export --format json --anonymize > my-deployment.json
```

Submit to the [sundew-data](https://github.com/sundew-sh/sundew-data) repository.

### Documentation

Improvements to these docs, new guides, tutorials, and translations.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sundew-sh/sundew.git
cd sundew

# Install with dev dependencies (using uv)
uv sync --all-extras

# Or using pip
pip install -e ".[dev,all]"

# Verify
make lint && make test
```

## Code Style

- **Python 3.11+** with modern syntax
- **Type hints** on all function signatures and return types
- **Ruff** for linting and formatting (config in `pyproject.toml`)
- **mypy** in strict mode
- **Google-style docstrings** on public functions and classes
- **Line length**: 100 characters

```bash
make lint   # ruff check + ruff format --check + mypy
make fmt    # auto-format
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch
2. Make your changes with tests
3. Run `make lint && make test`
4. Submit a PR with a clear description
5. Address review feedback

PRs should be focused -- one feature or fix per PR. Large changes should be discussed in an issue first.

## Security

If you find a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**. Follow the responsible disclosure process in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/sundew-sh/sundew/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

If you find a way to fingerprint Sundew deployments, that is also a security issue. Report it privately.

## Community

- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sundew-sh/sundew/discussions) for questions and ideas
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sundew-sh/sundew/issues) for bugs and feature requests

Thank you for helping make Sundew better.
